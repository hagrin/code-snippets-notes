# Simple Telegram Bot

## Just some notes on how to create a Telegram bot.

1) New node.js project in whatever IDE you want to use
2) npm init
3) In your Telegram app, search for @BotFather (will be verified)
4) Start a conversation with the BotFather
5) Send /newbot command
6) You will be required to pick a name for the bot - this can be anything you want
7) You will then be asked to pick a bot name that ends in either *Bot or *_bot and this does need to be unique to Telegram.
8) Once you choose a unique name, your bot will be created and you will receive an HTTP API token. Copy that into a safe, secure location.
